### marks
  Setting marks:
  - m{a-z} - Set a local mark (lowercase letters are file-specific)
  - m{A-Z} - Set a global mark (uppercase letters work across files)
  Jumping to marks:
  - \`a - Jump to exact position (line and column) of mark 'a'
  - 'a - Jump to first non-blank character of line with mark 'a'
  Special marks:
  - \`. - Jump to last change position
  - \`" - Jump to last position when file was closed
  - \`[ - Jump to beginning of last change/yank`
  - \`] - Jump to end of last change/yank
  - '^ - Position where you last inserted text
  - '< - Start of last visual selection
  - '> - End of last visual selection
  List all marks:
  - :marks - Shows all marks
  Cycling through marks:
  - ]' - Jump to next line with a mark
  - [\' - Jump to previous line with a mark`
  - ]\`  - Jump to next mark (exact position)
  - [\`  - Jump to previous mark (exact position)`
  - \<leader\>sm - Search marks (shows list of all marks you can fuzzy search)
think about:
  mm - main function
  mt - types/structs
  mf - first function (or "focus" - what you're currently working on)
  mc - constants
  mi - imports
  me - error handling
